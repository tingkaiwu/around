## Overview

Photo Social Circle was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This project is a geo & photo based social media site, and I built it by React and token-based server-side user authentication (JWT). The purpose of this project was to learn how to use React to develop a morden framework frontend. In addition, I also created features, such as create/browse/search nearby posts, with GeoLocation API and Google Map API. Used Google Vision API to provide a face detection model, and integrate the model with the Go service. The backend of this project was create in Golang, and used Elasticsearch (GCE) to provide geo-based search features
